# Touch Rugby DAO: The Future of Sports

## Overview
The Touch Rugby DAO (TR-DAO) is a community-powered revolution turning Touch Rugby into the world's first community-owned, community-governed Olympic sport. This platform serves as the central hub for the movement, providing governance tools, educational resources, and a roadmap for global expansion.

## Key Pillars
- **Transparency**: Every decision and dollar is visible on the blockchain.
- **Community Ownership**: $TOUCH tokens represent influence and success sharing.
- **Merit-Based Governance**: Contribution (playing, coaching, organizing) earns voting power.
- **Problem Solving**: Fixing governance failures by tapping into a global talent pool.

## Features
- **AI Consultant**: A real-time advisor powered by Google Gemini to answer questions about the DAO and its transition strategy.
- **Member Dashboard**: A local task management system to track personal contributions and proposed actions (persisted via LocalStorage).
- **Technical Whitepaper**: Detailed architectural specs including Quadratic Voting (QV) logic and tokenomics.
- **Interactive Roadmap**: A clear 3-phase plan from 2026 to 2028 leading to an Olympic demonstration event.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 with Tailwind CSS for high-performance, responsive UI.
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai) for intelligent community support.
- **Governance Tools**: LocalStorage-based tracking for individual impact.
- **Design**: "Glassmorphism" aesthetic with an emphasis on clarity and sports-tech branding.
